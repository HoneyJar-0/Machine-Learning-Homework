# HW2
## Tasks
1. Compute the optimal weights and biases using an analytical solution for a linear regression model
   - use 1/2 Mean square error (MSE) to measure loss
   - optimize the weights and biases on the training set, and report the loss on the testing set
2. Use gradient descent to optimize the weights and biases for a linear regression model
   - pick a random starting value for the weights and biases
   - pick a small learning rate
   - Perform a fixed number T of gradient descent iterations
   - report the training and testing loss
   - 
3. Implement L2 regularization in the previous regression attempt.
   - record the training and testing losses
4. Visualize the learned weights from each training method
   - include the top 5 images whose errors were the largest from the L2 regularization + GD method
