# HW1
## Tasks
### Part 1
1. Refamiliarize yourself with calculus and linear algebra. Perform the calculations provided (not included here)
### Part 2
1. Familiarize yourself with numpy and python syntax by performing the given tasks (not included here)
### Part 3
1. Train a step-wise classification algorithnm
   - train the classifier for m = 6 features by comparing ONLY 2 pixels
   - maximize the percent correct accuracy (implement as well)
   - For every round of examination, the algorithm should examine every possible feature
       - Note you should vectorize your code to improve performance
   - Each predictor should be computed over all the images WITHOUT using a loop
2. Write code to analyze how the training/testing accuracy changes as the number of examples increase. You may use a loop here.
3. visualize the m features learned by the algorithm
