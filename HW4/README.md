# HW4
## Tasks:
### Part 1
1. Optimize the hyperplane normal vector w and bias b to maximize the margin between the two classes provided
   a. each data point should be on the correct side of the hyperplane (hard-margin SVM)
   b. use cvxopt's quadratic programming solver for this task
2. Generate predictions on a matrix of test examples
### Part 2
1. Finish provided template code in test1 to plot the optimal separating hyperplane H obtained from part 1.
