# MachineLearningHW
Hello! In this repo are 5 folders, each referring to the work I did for my machine learning course at WPI. While I will summarize what each folder contains in this readme, each folder will have another readme going into more depth about what I had to do.

## HW1: step-wise classification
+ binary classification of grayscale images
+ introduction to feature engineering

## HW2: Linear regression for age estimation- 3 methods
+ analytical (optimal weights and biases calculated)
+ Gradient descent (no regularization)
+ Gradient descent + L2 regularization

## HW3: Multinomial logistic regression (softmax regression)
+ softmax regressor on MNIST fashion dataset + L2 regularization
+ softmax regressor on Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition

## HW4: Support Vector Machines with sklearn
+ familiarity with quadratic programming
+ hyperplane plotting

## HW5: Neural networks from scratch
+ 3-layer dense neural network trained for age estimation (see HW2)
+ hyperparameter tuning
+ backpropagation
+ stoichastic gradient descent

### Note to reader:
You may notice there isn't much of a commit history here. This is because of both an old private repo issue and computer-side issues. Please see my other projects to get a better grasp of my frequency of commits and pushes.
